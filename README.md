  George Clark Rotate Challenge
</h1>

Ready to view [**HERE**](/)

_A Gatsby starter using product data reproduced from an Aesop product page, and deployed as a simple JSON api._

Tech used:
- React
- Gatsby v3
- GraphQL & gatsby-image-plugin
- SCSS
- JSON-server mock api: [**repo**](https://github.com/h0rhay/json-server-mock-api) / [**endpoint**](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/h0rhay/json-server-mock-api/)

Would like to improve:
- Testing
- A11y
- Theming
- Finish it! (There's a LOT of functionality and UX to reproduce for this challenge..)
